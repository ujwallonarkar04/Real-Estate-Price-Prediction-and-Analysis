# Real Estate Price Prediction and Analysis

This Python project focuses on predicting real estate prices based on Manhattan sales data from August 2012 to August 2013. It covers a range of tasks including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning modeling.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- SciPy

## Usage
- Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
- Import the provided dataset `Manhattan12.csv`.
- Run the Python script to perform data cleaning, EDA, and modeling.
- Analyze model performance, visualize correlations, and understand the dataset.

## Steps Covered:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and transform data types.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand the dataset.
3. Feature engineering and scaling numerical features for modeling.
4. Linear Regression model for price prediction.
5. RandomForestRegressor model for improved price prediction.
6. K-Means Clustering to identify patterns in the dataset.
7. Cluster-based regression analysis for predicting prices within clusters.

## Files Included:
- `Manhattan12.csv`: Dataset containing Manhattan real estate sales data.
- `RealEstatePricePrediction.py`: Python script for analysis and modeling.
- `README.md`: Documentation providing project details and instructions.
